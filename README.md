# Python-Turtle-Graphics-Challenges
This repository contains a series of Python challenges using the Turtle graphics library. The challenges include drawing shapes, creating dashed lines, simulating random walks, and making colorful spirographs.

# Challenges Overview
1. Square Drawing: Draw a square using direct commands and loops.
2. Dashed Line: Create a dashed line pattern using penup and pendown methods.
3. Shape Drawing: Draw shapes with varying sides (triangle to decagon) using a function.
4. Random Walk: Implement a random walk pattern with a list of predefined colors.
5. Random Colors: Generate random RGB colors for drawing.
6. Spirograph: Create an intricate spirograph using a circle drawing technique with random colors.

# Features
- Draw various geometric shapes (squares, polygons)
- Create dashed lines
- Simulate random walks with a list of colors
- Generate random colors using RGB values
- Create intricate spirograph designs

# Usage
- The script will execute a series of Turtle graphics challenges sequentially, demonstrating various drawing techniques.
- You can modify parameters (like the number of sides for shapes, colors, and speed) in the code to experiment with different outputs.
